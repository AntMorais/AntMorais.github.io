I am a Portuguese graduate student at the University of Coimbra. Currently I am working on my Master's thesis on Robust Neural Networks in the context of safety-critical problems. My current research interests revolve around Computer Vision, including Image Classification, Image Segmentation, and everything in between. 

I am open to research opportunities in Computer Vision. If you have any questions you can contact me at [antoniomorais.nn@gmail.com](mailto:antoniomorais.nn@gmail.com).
